# Disability representation in Korean movies visualization project

By Team Magic Conch Shell, as a course project of *Data Visualization and Analysis* at Seoul National University
To see our final product and analysis on the topic, please visit our [interactive visualization website](https://disability-in-korean-movies.herokuapp.com/) or watch our [demo video](https://youtu.be/3c733rlrjjw).

## 0. About the project
This project's goal is to explore how disabled individuals are represented in Korean movies for the past 20 years. We first gathered Korean movies which depict characters with disability. Then, using  [face++](https://www.faceplusplus.com/) face detection API, we automatically detected and identified each character's face emotions. The project is in progress to convey our analysis of character emotion and image data via an interactive visualization website.
